# Description

Simple program to download a Udemy course, has support for DRM videos but requires the user to aquire the decryption key (for legal reasons).<br>
Current only Windows is supported but with some small modifications it should work on linux also (and maybe mac)

# Requirements

1. You would need to download `ffmpeg` and `mp4decrypter`from Bento4 SDK and ensure they are in path (typing their name in cmd invokes them).

# Usage

_quick and dirty how-to_

You will need to get a few things before you can use this program:

- Decryption Key ID
- Decryption Key
- Udemy Course ID
- Udemy Bearer Token

### Setting up

- rename `.env.sample` to `.env`
- rename `keyfile.example.json` to `keyfile.json`

### Aquire bearer token
